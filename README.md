###Student dropout prevention web application

## Project general pitch:
* Admins quarterly may automatically send email requests to their teachers for data
* Data updated quarterly 
* Data collection based on 24 separate indicators of dropping out
* Teachers are notified via email to prompt their students and their parents to fill out respective google forms
* Teachers then themselves fill out their own google form
* During a period of time, data is collected. At the end of the period, the data is run through an algorithm that determines which students are most prone to dropping out
* Admins have access to both the full list of students + information, and the "compiled" version that shows which students are most likely to drop out
* Affirmative action can be taken on students who are most likely to drop out, as the school is able
* Every time admin page is loaded, the web page uses API to read from the spreadsheets and send information into the algorithm

## Stretch goals:
* Implement true accounts, which utilizes databases to store data
* Implement option for parents and teachers to communicate with each other using notes
* Find higher-than-admin AI to prompt admin to send out forms
